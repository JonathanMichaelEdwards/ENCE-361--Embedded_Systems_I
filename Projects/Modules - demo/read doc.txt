want all files to be in the folders as they are please...
e.g

- include
	* .h files
- libs
	* OLED libary
- src
	* .c files

- There are a few different examples for testing the modules in the            Examples folder.
- All the labs are in the         Labs folder
- Modules are not perfect yet but        are "all" layed out apart from interuppts -> will be added soon

- If u have any problem linking e.g "cannot find files from header"
    "Remember" right click on the file that ur working on and changes the includes.
- You can also set the folders with the project. e.g same as above but for whole project.
